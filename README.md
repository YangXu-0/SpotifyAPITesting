# SpotifyAPITesting

Originally started out as a script to sort tracks in playlists/albums by play count so that I could find the most popular songs when I go through new playlists. Unfortunately, Spotify still hasn't made that information available through their web API so now it's just a script where you can search a playlist and it returns a list of all the songs :/  . Hopefully they'll update in the future and I can finish this.
